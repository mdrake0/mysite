I'm Matt Drake, a software developer in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

I enjoy working on backend systems and data engineering tasks.

For fun, I like (board|tabletop|video) games, books, and music. I own too many
keyboards.

I also like baseball. You can often find me at baseball games, nerding out with
my awesome wife. Go Nats!
